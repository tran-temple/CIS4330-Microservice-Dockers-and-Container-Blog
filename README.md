## Thoughts
After installing Docker, finishing the 4 steps of tutorial, and reading more resource on the internet, the following is some findings and some thoughts:
- Docker is an application virtualization tool while virtual box is a virtual machine tool.
- Virtual box simulates an entire hardware environment while Docker isolates the reads/writes of the enclosed application from the rest of the OS.
- Docker images are templates. They are unchangeable, and we can't start them. We use template as a base to build a container.
- Images can exist without containers, whereas a container needs to run an image to exist. Therefore, containers are dependent on images and use them to construct a run-time environment and run an application.
